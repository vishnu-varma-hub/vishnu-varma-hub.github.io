 <font style="position:absolute;left:420px;top:150px;right:70px;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:17px;">How do self-ligating braces work? 
 Self-ligating braces use a specialized clip in place of elastics to help the archwire guide teeth into place.
 The clip helps reduce the amount of pressure being placed on the tooth, and decreases the number of adjustments because there are no elastics to replace.
 Self-ligating braces are made from the same materials as traditional braces; 
 however, self-ligating braces do not require the use of elastics, meaning fewer appointments and less friction being placed on the tooth. 
 Self-ligating braces come with traditional metal, ceramic, or clear brackets.</font>

<font style="position:absolute;left:420px;top:350px;right:70px;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:17px;">A power chain has nothing to do with weightlifting or motor boats. 
For you and your braces, power chains are connected rows of elastics that are used in orthodontics to help with a variety of issues.
 This treatment has grown in popularity recently, partly because of the versatility it offers.
In modern orthodontics, there are about a dozen types of braces from which to choose. Power chains are commonly used in conjunction with the brackets attached to your teeth.

 <font style="position:absolute;left:420px;top:550px;right:70px;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:17px;">Damon braces are self-ligating appliances 
 that are fitted in the same way as traditional metal braces. But instead of having brackets that tighten and adjust the braces regularly,
 Damon braces use a slide mechanism that attaches wires to brackets to move naturally with the teeth as they realign. This makes them more comfortable,
 better looking and able to provide strong results in a shorter time.These braces use a different method for moving teeth into the right position.
